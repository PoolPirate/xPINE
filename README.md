## Building && Running
### Build Docker Container

- Make sure you have docker & docker compose installed and the docker daemon is running.
- Navigate to the `docker/build` directory
- `docker build . -t rolebaseddao:latest --build-arg github_username=**yourGithubUsername** --build-arg github_token=**yourGithubAccessToken**`

- This will build the image and tag it with `rolebaseddao:latest`
### Run the image
You could run it manually with `docker run` but the repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file. 
- Navigate to the `docker` directory
- Run `docker-compose up`
    - You can add volumes / change application ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file

This image will run a local ganache instance. To get the private keys generated by that instance check `docker-compose logs`. Those private keys can then be imported into Metamask to get 1000 ETH on the local testnet.
